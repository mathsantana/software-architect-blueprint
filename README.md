# Software Architect Blueprint

> "Trust me! It's the best plan ever"

## Motivation

You know the code, but it's not **ALL** about the code. Write a good software doesn't rely only in choose variables names right, it's about all the architecture and infrastructure decisions and implementations. This is the next level, baby. Now, it’s time to know how to choose the better tools to build a good system. But don't worry if the path to Software Architecture has felt like a dark maze. Grab your flashlight: this is the definitive, no-nonsense (?) roadmap, probably... No, no. **THE BEST** plan you will ever find. Stop winging it. If you're serious about the title, start here. Period.
