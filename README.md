## Motivation

You know the code, but it's not **ALL** about the code. Now, itâ€™s time to define the entire system. The path to Software Architecture has felt like a dark maze. Well, grab your flashlight: this is the definitive, no-nonsense (?) roadmap, probably... No, no. **THE BEST** plan you will ever find. Stop winging it. If you're serious about the title, start here. Period.
