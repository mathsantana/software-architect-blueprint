> **Requirements engineering**Â is the subfield of software engineering completely focused on making sure that we can turn the plain-language explanation of what a software need is into something that is actionable by a development team.
> *"CS 3240"*

Requirements are features and constraints that users define how the system should behave.

> Software requirements should be viewed from two perspectives. The first is as an expression of the needs and constraints on a software product or project that contribute to the solution of a real-world problem. The second is that of the activities necessary to develop and maintain the requirements for a software product and for the project that constructs it.

Not defining requirements or not doing it right have a high cost, because all the requirements will lead to one or many code decision, one or maybe many test decisions.
