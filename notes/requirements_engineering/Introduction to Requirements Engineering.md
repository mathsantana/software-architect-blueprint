Requirements are features and constraints that users define how the system should behave.

Not defining requirements or not doing it right have a high cost, because all the requirements will lead to one or many code decision, one or maybe many test decisions.

## Level of requirements

* User requirement
	* Uses natural language to specify
	* Focus more in what program should do
	* High level requirements
* System requirement
	* Define what system should do to meet one or more user requirements
	* Focus more on how the program should do
	* Low level requirements

## Types of requirements

* Functional requirements
	* Define what the system should do (behavior)
	* Input -> Output
	* What time should program do what 

* Non-functional requirements
	* Define what the system should be (characteristics)
	* Norms and constraints
	* Requirements of memory, performance
